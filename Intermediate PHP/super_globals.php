<?php
// Some information about super globals in PHP.

/* A PHP superglobal is an associate array of data that's created by the server to
capture information from URLs, HTML forms, cookies, sessions and web servers. It's
called a 'superglobal' because the information in the array is available everywhere
in your scripts */

/* Superglobals can be used globally with typing the 'global' keyword before the variable
name, making them available in all functions or methods by default! */

// Link to documentation for all available superglobals... https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.variables.superglobals.php

// ** CODE EXAMPLE OF _$GET **

    /* Use the $_GET method if the information youâ€™ll be passing is not sensitive 
    or a security vulnerability. For example, a search function is a common use 
    case which will pass the data through the URL. */

    /* Use the $_POST superglobal if you want to send sensitive data to a file or 
    database in a more secure way. For example, when passing a secure user password 
    it's best to do so with a $_POST request that doesn't display the data in a 
    query string in the URL. */
